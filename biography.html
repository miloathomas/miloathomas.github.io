	<h2><b>Childhood and inspirations</b></h2>

	<p>I grew up with a Dad who is in the digital art field. I was so amazed by any art he did, and immediately fell in love when I started drawing. I’m a very creative person and also developed a strong passion towards creative writing. In 2018 my school required us to have an iPad, it was at this point which I learnt I could draw myself. I fell in love with a community on YouTube called ‘Gacha Tubers’, it was the first look I had into animation and digital art. I would draw with my finger on my little iPad mini, I remember drawing so much that my finger would start to cramp. And as soon as I had finished my newest creation, I would run to my parents to show them. </p>

	<h2><b>Getting serious with art</b></h2> 
	
<p>After drawing on my iPad for a year, I had saved up enough money to get an Apple Pencil. My Dad had found a second hand one on eBay that had only ever been used once. I remember getting home from school and absolutely jumping for joy at being able to use it. After receiving the Apple Pencil, I didn’t put down my iPad for weeks. I even created an Instagram account to upload my art.</p>
	
<p>It was around year 9 that I applied for an art school and was later accepted. I spent the entire holidays practising and perfecting new art skills in anticipation. By this point I was certain that I wanted to work in character concept art, and I hoped that this school would help me achieve those dreams.</p>
	
	<h2><b>What am I doing now?</b></h2>

	<p>As of now I am still studying at school. I aim to complete a fine arts course at university once I graduate. My dream is to work in Japan as a character concept artist doing models and commissions on the side. I would like to start streaming myself one day however I’m unsure when I will begin that. As for now I am more than happy making others smile when I can bring their characters to life and I hope I can continue doing that.</p>
