		<h2> What to excpect to pay</h2>
			
			<p>I am very happy to work with a deadline set by you, however the deadline must not be anymore than 2 weeks. If I am unable to meet the agreed upon time, you will receive a refund. As of the moment there is no waiting time to begin commissions. </p>	

	
	    <p> Each work will have a beginning price. When discussing details or changes, the price may go up. However the finish price will be agreed upon before I start. Starting price is non negotiable. Commissioners will be required to pay half the full price before the drawing and the other half when receiving the final art piece.
		      
		      Are you looking for cheaper or more affordable art? I offer coloured sketches! By commissioning a sketch the price can drop up to $30. Sketches will not be fully rendered or include any line art. </p>

		<h2>What does a commission by me look like?</h2>
		<p>When commissioning me I will update you roughly 3-4 times during the creative process. You will receive a sketch which is the final time to ask for any changes regarding poses, outfits and any other physical details.
