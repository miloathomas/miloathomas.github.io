		<p>If you have been following my art for a long time you would see this red haired character appear many times. She first appeared back in 2019 with her girlfriend Midnight. Though her design has changed a lot through the years she is still recognisable by her bright red hair and green eyes. This piece in particular was an attempt on a more dynamic pose. Clara in a sense follows my own life so here she holds a more masculine body type.

	If you love clowns I am the person to draw them for you! This clown character is also a regular Oc which does not have a name yet, in most of my art pieces I like to convey a mysterious dead face kind of vibe. A prominent feature of my style being the eyes.

	This is an example of my more chibi like style, I’ll tend to use a more simplistic shading. This character's name happens to be the original ‘Nex’ and is the oc that represents me. Once again her style is very simplistic and this would be an example of a $50 commission.

	This is an example of a character sheet that I can provide. This was for xan on twitter. Him and his chat helped design this model and I was very happy to work with him. My character sheets will normally consist of a head shot, and then side and front profile. However I am more than happy to add any extra details.
